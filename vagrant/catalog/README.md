# Catalog App

## Getting Started
1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
1. Clone the [fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)
1. In the terminal, change directory to where you cloned the repository with `cd`. Then change directory to **vagrant** directory.
1. Run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is.
1. When `vagrant up` is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM!
1. `cd` into `/vagrant/catalog`.
1. Run `python populatecatalog.py` to populate the catalog with predefined categories. Feel free to change `populatecatalog.py` to create your own categories.
1. Run `python application.py` to start the application.
1. Access and test the application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally.
